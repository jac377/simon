# Simon
This is my implementation of Simon, the game.<br>

## Purpose
Be able to practice and showcase what I am learning as I step through the process of replicating Simon, from CS260 Class.

## Project Status

Finished, and a final pushed to the server was done on 2/8/2023.
## What I have learned so far

2/7/2023 - While I was working on the ***play.html*** and ***scores.html***, I explored a little more between `<table>` and the `<thead>`. Both are the same, but when we include the later one, it becomes a more structured table. 
`<th>` vs `<td>`. The first one is for headings, the second one is for the body of the table.

Finished this part of the project.

2/6/2023 - For the first time, I was able to see how the HTML structure works. At first, it wasn't very intuitive, but as I moved along, I was able to indentify many of the elements I was playing with while learning HTML. For example, the "text" input. Moreover, as I copied the ***deployFiles.sh***, I was able to understand what we are doing every time we deploy our program.
