# Simon
This is my implementation of Simon, the game.<br>

## Purpose
Be able to practice and showcase what I am learning as I step through the process of replicating Simon, from CS260 Class.

## What I have learned so far

2/6/2023 - For the first time, I was able to see how the HTML structure works. At first, it wasn't very intuitive, but as I moved along, I was able to indentify many of the elements I was playing with while learning HTML. For example, the "text" input. Moreover, as I copied the ***deployFiles.sh***, I was able to understand what we are doing every time we deploy our program.
